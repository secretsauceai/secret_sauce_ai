# Introduction

Secret Sauce AI is an open source program (program in the sense of management, not software) for projects to identify blockers and improve the basic open source tools and pipeline components in the AI (voice) assistant pipeline (wakeword, ASR, NLU, NLG, TTS) mostly geared for deployment on edge devices and self hosted solutions. This is not a voice assistant project in and of itself, rather Secret Sauce AI helps AI (voice) assistant projects come together as individuals and solve basic problems faced by the entire community. 

## Focus

- tools
    - data collection
    - other small automation tools (automate: tutorials, how to's, recipes, etc. as CLIs, skills, and/or web tools)
- modular (can swap out components easily for customization, ie microservices)
- tweaking existing open source resources for improvements
- emphasis on 'tiny ML' and user-based data collection (data collection driven)
    - system learns from the user
    - data collection stays on the local device, it belongs to the user!
- documentation and how to's to help folks setup their own AI
    - Get a user onboarded by asking: "what's your personal AI (voice) assistant's MVP?"

## Philosophy

How many folks want their own AI, but even though we live in the future from our childhood dreams, it doesn't seem any closer. The open source community isn't there yet. With Secret Sauce AI, we help people achieve their dreams of their own personal AI by providing that secret sauce flavor.

Note the term 'personal AI'. Everyone has their own use cases, their own ideas. The AI has to be modular and customizable to realize these dreams. But it needs one more component, the most important of all...

It needs to learn from the user's interactions (without the user having to program it!). If an AI can't learn, it isn't an AI. People will have a lot more patients for an AI that actually learns. When they know they can teach it, they will want to treat it more like a child and they will be even more immersed in the 'Wizard of Oz' effect. 

## Method

The method statement is simple yet is complex because an AI (voice) assistant covers a broad domain of disciplines and the process is also iterative:

- Define your personal MVP
    - requirements
    - blockers
    - open questions (problem statements)
    - resources
- Break down the general domain of AI (voice) assistants (wake word, ASR, NLU, NLG, TTS, etc.) by category and:
    - blockers
    - how to's
    - open questions (problem statements)
    - resources
- Align the aspects of your MVP with that of the general domain categories (surprise, everyone has the same problems you do!)
- Prioritize work on the aligned components based on difficulty, always pick the lowest hanging fruit first
- Repeat

This method was first employed on the wake word problem(s), as this seems to be a quintessential problem of voice assistants. Almost all voice assistant systems require a good wake word system and none exists. Although in comparison to other categories, it could be called the lowest hanging fruit (less problems to solve, easier to scope, partial solutions exist). It was the hope of the program that this would galvanize the open source AI (voice) assistant community and in the process provide valuable deliverables that would unblock individuals' MVPs. 

Each category will spin off projects that will provide the deliverables that will greatly improve MVPs. The projects are there to help individuals achieve their MVPs.

## Key vocabulary

- ***utterance:*** command, question, or query from a user (ie 'turn on the kitchen lights')
- ***response:*** the written response to an utterance by the assistant/chatbot (ie 'I turned on the living room lights')
- ***word slotting:*** often times a response is based on a template and words are slotted in to give a correct response, this can also include grammar (this is pretty easy in English, it's in other languages that templating becomes more complex and is often overlooked in the construction of such systems) (ie 'the living room lights are now on' template: the [entity] [singular|plural] now on)
- ***tagged words:*** utterances can contain inputs for actions and/or responses, these are referred to as entities, tagging these entities is also known as NER (named entity recognition) (ie 'turn on the kitchen lights', entity: kitchen lights)
- ***intent:*** when an utterance is classified for its action and or response (some systems use the tagged words to find intent, others use the whole utterance) (ie 'turn on the kitchen lights' -> skill: home assistant, action: turn on/off, entity: kitchen lights)
- ***NLU:*** natural language understanding, this usually describes finding the intent and word tagging more generally (ie NLU engine, an engine that performs the intent classification and word tagging)
- ***NLG:*** natural language generation, this describes the creation of responses to utterances. It can include actual generation (using some kind of language model that requires the utterance as prompt), or the more common approach of using templates and word slotting.
- ***ASR:*** automated speech recognition, also known as STT, speech to text.
- ***wakeword:*** a specific word or phrase (for best results it should be at least 3 syllables) trained into a binary class acoustic model (wakeword or not-wakeword) used to activate the ASR (ie 'hey jarvis')
- ***TTS:*** text to speech
- ***NLP:*** natural language processing, this covers all of these tasks and many more

# Wake Word Problem Statements

- Pipeline
    - Many deprecated and/or closed-source solutions (ie Snowboy or Porcupine) and outdated or otherwise limited solutions (ie Pocketsphinx)
    - Only open source solution (Precise) is old (tf 1.13), heavy (26kb, uses ~25-30% CPU on raspi4 at all times).
- Data collection/training
    - Hard to train good models without deep knowledge and lots of data

## Proposed Solutions

- Create easy way to:
    - ~~collect data~~  (prototype done)
    - train optimal models (in progress: ALMOST DONE!)
- ~~Migrate Precise to tflite~~ (done)
- Experiment with optimal compression of tflite model
- Turn Precise TF2 runner (engine) into binary or otherwise easy to use deployment
    - Many folks want to run it on Android too!

For all the details of the solutions for the Wake Word project, see the wakeword project [documentation](https://www.notion.so/Wake-Word-Project-9f51d7db8e4b4510a9b097186536e6d6).

# NLU-NLG Problem Statements

The NLU-NLG project documentation, much like the NLU-NLG project itself, is still a work in progress. Stay tuned. It will be formalized once the prototype wake word project is completed. ðŸ™‚
